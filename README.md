Description
-----------
OpenSCAD design for a chain link.

Instructions
------------
Clip two halves together to make the first link.
For the next link do the same, but puttig through the first link.
Repeat until you have a chain.

Would benefit from being printed in a slightly flexible plastic, to cope with impact.
