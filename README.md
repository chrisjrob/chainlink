Description
-----------
OpenSCAD design for a chain link.
The two halves clip together, generally without the need for glue.

Status
------
Complete.

Instructions
------------
* Edit SCAD file with your preferred parameters.
* Set selection, depending on whether you wish to print all or part of the link.
* Compile and export to STL.
* Alternatively download the included STL.
* Slice with a brim - this is only required for the male part.
* Print.

Would benefit from being printed in a slightly flexible plastic, to cope with impact.

Assembly
--------
Clip two halves together to make the first link.
For the next link do the same, but putting through the first link.
Repeat until you have a chain.
